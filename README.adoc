== Configuring Hazelcast

Before starting to use Hazelcast inside the application, let's configure it in `HazelcastApplication.java`:

[source, java]
----
@Produces
HazelcastInstance create() {
    Config config = new Config();
    // all other configurations (networking,
    // listeners, etc.) can be set here.
    MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig();
    mapConfig.setName(MAP_NAME);
    mapConfig.setTimeToLiveSeconds(30);
    config.addMapConfig(mapConfig);
    return Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
}
----

`create()` method will supply HazelcastInstance wherever it is injected:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
HazelcastInstance instance;
----

Now that we have a HazelcastInstance, we can reach to the distributed map over the instance:

[source, java]
----
private IMap<Integer,String> getDistributedMap() {
    return instance.getMap(HazelcastApplication.MAP_NAME);
}
----

NOTE: Since we call the map with `MAP_NAME` - which we configured before, it will have 30 seconds of time-to-live.

And that's all! The distributed map is ready to use now.
[source, java]
----
IMap<Integer,String> map = getDistributedMap();
map.put(1, "value");
map.get(1);
map.putIfAbsent(1, "another_value");
----

Now, let's start up two different servers and deploy the applications.

Start the first server listening on port 9080:

----
$ cd server1
$ mvn install liberty:run-server
----

In another terminal session, start the second server listening on port 9081:

----
$ cd server2
$ mvn install liberty:run-server
----

After two servers are up and ready, you will see the logs:

----
The HazelcastGuides1 server is ready to run a smarter planet.
...
The HazelcastGuides2 server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

Let's give it a try:

----
$ curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9080/application/map/put?key=1&value=greetings_from_server1"
Put: greetings_from_server1. Old value was: null

$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:9081/application/map/get?key=1"
{ 1 : greetings_from_server1 }

$ curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9081/application/map/put?key=2&value=cool"
Put: cool. Old value was: null

$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:9080/application/map/list"
Size: 2
{ 1: greetings_from_server1 }
{ 2: cool }
----

Note that after 30 seconds, these values will be evicted.

== Summary

In this guide, we developed a simple application that stores the data in a
Hazelcast instance. We started two application instances, and they formed a
Hazelcast cluster. Since the data was shared among Hazelcast cluster instances,
we could access it from both application instances.
